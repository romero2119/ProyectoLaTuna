Accessibilik: A React-based web accessibility widget to enhance UI/UX for all users.

```
yarn add accessibility-react-widget
```
Or
```
npm install accessibility-react-widget
```
Or
```
<script defer src="https://acc-landing.vercel.app/accessibilik.min.js"></script>
```


Then use it in your app:

```js
import Accessibilik from 'accessibility-react-widget';

export default function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MyApp/>
      <Accessibilik />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Next.js (App Router)

The widget runs only on the client and is compatible with Next.js App Router. The published bundle includes the `"use client"` directive, so you can import it directly in Server Components (e.g. `layout.tsx`); Next.js will treat it as a client boundary.

```js
// app/layout.tsx
import Accessibilik from 'accessibility-react-widget';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Accessibilik />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, use the dedicated Next.js entry for an explicit client-only import:

```js
import Accessibilik from 'accessibility-react-widget/next';
```
